RD: RELATIVE DISTANCE
WT: WAITING TIME OF CALLER
FS: FREE SPACE OF ELEVATOR

CALCULATION OF VARIABLES:

1) RD= 0 (if lift is on way of called floor)
   
   IF STATIONARY 

   RD= |STATIONARY FLOOR- CALLED FLOOR|

   else RD= |NEAREST DESTINATION FLOOR- CALLED FLOOR|

2) WT= Time an elevator takes from its cuurrent location to called floor

   Assuming elevator takes 1 unit of time b/w 2 floors then,
   WT= |CURRENT LOCATION - CALLED FLOOR|

3) FS= Total capacity - Current load of lift
